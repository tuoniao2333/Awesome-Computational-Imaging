|&#9745;|2022|Incorporating the image formation process into deep learning improves network performance|[Nat. Methods](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01652-7)|[Tensorflow](https://github.com/MeatyPlus/Richardson-Lucy-Net)|RLN combines the traditional Richardson-Lucy iteration with a fully convolutional network structure, establishing a connection to the image formation process and thereby improving network performance.||
