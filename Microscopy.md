Commun.](https://www-nature-com.accproxy.lib.szu.edu.cn/articles/s41467-024-48575-9#Sec30)  |[Tensorflow](https://github.com/TristaZeng/ZS-DeconvNet)  | |We used experimentally acquired or simulated PSFs(with PSF Generator Fiji plugin licensed by EPFL) that are corresponding to the imaging configurations.|
|&#9745;|2022|Incorporating the image formation process into deep learning improves network performance|[Nat. Methods](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01652-7)|[Tensorflow](https://github.com/MeatyPlus/Richardson-Lucy-Net)|RLN combines the traditional Richardson-Lucy iteration with a fully convolutional network structure, establishing a connection to the image formation process and thereby improving network performance.||
