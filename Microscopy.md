||2024| **Zero-shot learning** enables instant denoising and super-resolution in optical fluorescence microscopy| [Nat. Commun.](https://www-nature-com.accproxy.lib.szu.edu.cn/articles/s41467-024-48575-9#Sec30)  |[Tensorflow](https://github.com/TristaZeng/ZS-DeconvNet)  | |We used experimentally acquired or simulated PSFs (with PSF Generator Fiji plugin licensed by EPFL) that are corresponding to the imaging configurations.|
||2023|Field-dependent deep learning enables high-throughput whole-cell 3D super-resolution imaging|[Nat. Methods]( https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01775-5)|[Pytorch](https://github.com/Li-Lab-SUSTech/FD-DeepLoc)|1.We present FD-DeepLoc, which combines both fast spatially variant PSF modeling and deep-learning-based single-molecule localization to achieve 3D super resolution over a large FOV and deep of field. 2.We introduce a small aberration variation to the trained PSF models, which **makes the network more robust when the theoretical and experimental PSF models are mismatched**.||
|&#9745;|2022|Incorporating the image formation process into deep learning improves network performance|[Nat. Methods](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01652-7)|[Tensorflow](https://github.com/MeatyPlus/Richardson-Lucy-Net)|RLN combines the traditional Richardson-Lucy iteration with a fully convolutional network structure, establishing a connection to the image formation process and thereby improving network performance.||
